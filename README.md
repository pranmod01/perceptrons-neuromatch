# Representational Geometry and Dynamics in Artificial Neural Networks of Visual Working Memory 

## Project Description
This project explores how different artificial neural architectures encode, maintain, and retrieve visual information. We analyze the geometry and dynamics of the representations across models, focusing on their implications for performance, robustness, and biological plausibility in visual working memory tasks.

We want to examine the following questions:
 1. How do spiking neural networks (SNNs) compare to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in encoding visual information for working memory tasks
 2. How do different memory architectures (RNN and SNN) handle maintenance and retrieval of encoded visual information in delayed match-to-sample tasks?
 3. How does the performance of an RNN and an SNN degrade as a function of increasing noise (delay) added during either the encoding or the maintenance phase of the task? Which architecture exhibits more robust representations?


## Used Dataset

We will use MNIST and N-MNIST (Orchard et al., 2015) examining our questions. Morespecifically, we will use MNIST for CNN, and N-MNIST for the SNN.
